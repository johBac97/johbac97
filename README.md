## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm John

I'm a software engineer specializing in Machine Learning. Currently, I'm a consultant at Mindified where I build scalable systems using both finetuned and off-the-shelf models. Outside of work, I dive deeper into AI through side projects, exploring new technologies, model architectures, and deployment strategies.
